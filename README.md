## üîî Notification System Flow

* When an event (e.g., freelancer applies) occurs, backend emits a `new_notification` via Socket.IO
* Client joins a private room based on their user ID
* Frontend listens for `new_notification` and updates UI in real-time
* Badge shows unread status
* REST API allows:

  * Marking individual or all notifications as read
  * Clearing all notifications
